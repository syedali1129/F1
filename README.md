Predictive Modeling of Formula 1 Race Winners Using Historical and Real-Time Data
Summary
This repository presents a machine learning approach to predicting Formula 1 race winners, leveraging historical data from the 2024 season and current races. It uses the FastF1 Python package to extract detailed telemetry, lap times, driver information, and track specifics for each Grand Prix. Real-time weather conditions are fetched via the OpenWeather API to capture key environmental variables affecting race outcomes.

The workflow includes data acquisition, feature engineering (driver, team, track, and weather metrics), and supervised learning models trained to forecast the probable race winner for each event. The code is modular and documented, supporting experimentation with various features and model types. This project is ideal for data science enthusiasts, motorsport fans, or teams aiming to understand the interplay between historical performance and real-time conditions in F1 racing.
